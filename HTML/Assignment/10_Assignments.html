			<h3>Classical Music</h3>
			<img src="../Images_html/classic.jpg" width="800px" height="300px" style="margin-left: 150px">
			<p> In a more general sense classical music refers to Western musical traditions considered to be apart from or a refinement of western folk music traditions and encompasses the broad span of time from before the 6th century AD to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods.The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1650 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period.</p>
			<p>The term "classical music" did not appear until the early 19th century, in an attempt to distinctly canonize the period from Johann Sebastian Bach to Ludwig van Beethoven as a golden age.The earliest reference to "classical music" recorded by the Oxford English Dictionary is from about 1829.</p>

			<h3>EDM Music</h3>
			<img src="../Images_html/edmic.jpg" width="800px" height="300px" style="margin-left: 150px">
			<p>It is generally produced for playback by DJs who create seamless selections of tracks, called a mix, by segueing from one recording to another.EDM producers also perform their music live in a concert or festival setting in what is sometimes called a live PA.</p>
			<p>In the late 1980s and early 1990s, following the emergence of raving, pirate radios, and an upsurge of interest in club culture, EDM achieved widespread mainstream popularity in Europe. In the United States at that time, acceptance of dance culture was not universal outside of New York City; although both electro and Chicago house music were influential both in Europe and the United States.</p>

			<h3>POP Music</h3>
			<img src="../Images_html/popic.jpg" width="800px" height="300px" style="margin-left: 150px">
			<p> During the 1950s and 1960s, pop encompassed rock and roll and the youth-oriented styles it influenced. Rock and pop remained roughly synonymous until the late 1960s, after which pop became associated with music that was more commercial, ephemeral, and accessible.</p>
			<p>Although much of the music that appears on record charts is seen as pop music, the genre is distinguished from chart music. Identifying factors usually include repeated choruses and hooks, short to medium-length songs written in a basic format (often the verse-chorus structure), and rhythms or tempos that can be easily danced to.</p>

			<h3>Folk Music</h3>
			<img src="../Images_html/folk.jpg" width="800px" height="300px" style="margin-left: 150px">
			<p>Traditional folk music has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, or music performed by custom over a long period of time. It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles. The term originated in the 19th century, but folk music extends beyond that.</p>
			<p>Folk music includes traditional folk music and the genre that evolved from it during the 20th-century folk revival. Some types of folk music may be called world music.</p>

			<h3>Instrumental</h3>
			<img src="../Images_html/instru.jpg" width="800px" height="300px" style="margin-left: 150px">
			<p>An instrumental is a recording normally without any vocals, although it might include some inarticulate vocals, such as shouted backup vocals in a big band setting. Through semantic widening, a broader sense of the word song may refer to instrumentals.</p>
			<p>In a song that is otherwise sung, a section that is not sung but which is played by instruments can be called an instrumental interlude, or, if it occurs at the beginning of the song, before the singer starts to sing, an instrumental introduction.</p>

			<h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">ABOUT US</h1>
			<h2>The Website created by musicians for musicians.</h2>
			<p>From the beginning we’ve had one goal: to empower artists to build effective websites for their music.</p>
			<p>It all started in 1999, with a single band website built by Bandzoogle's founder Chris Vinson for his alt-rock band, Rubberman. Grassroots promotion, plus the online community that the website created, helped the band get a record deal.</p>
			<p>In between tours, Chris worked at the record label designing websites for multi-platinum selling artists. To save time, he built a "control panel" to let artists make changes themselves. Realizing this could help independent bands and musicians build their own websites, Chris launched Bandzoogle in late 2003.</p>
